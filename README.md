# Socket.IO Group Chat Server

This project demonstrates the usage of **Socket.IO** by setting up a real-time group chat server using JavaScript and the **MERN Stack**.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Built using Socket.IO to allow seamless real-time chat between users.
- **MERN Stack**: Combines MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js for a full-stack application.
- **Scalability**: Can be easily expanded to support multiple rooms, users, and real-time events.
- **Cryptography**: Future implementation of cryptic methods to enhance chat security.
